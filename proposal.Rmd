#### Project Title :
Factors of Diabetes

#### Motivation: 
The project intends to analyze factors resulting in diabetes. The purpose of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient will have diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints select these instances from a larger database.

#### Intended Final Product: 
In this study, we are going to find out which factors influence a patient's risk of developing diabetes, and how large the effect is for each factor and develop a predictive tool for it. We will create a webpage and a two-minute narrated screencast illustrating our project

#### Data Sources: 
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

#### Planned analyses: 

Logistic regression model 

#### Visualizations: 

Use boxplot, barplot, density plot, etc. (ggplot) and interactive plots (plotly) to visualize the relationship between independent variables and the occurrence of diabetes
#### Coding challenges: 
Due to the complexity of multiple independent variables in this dataset, we need to spend more time on model selection to build an optimal one for our project.

#### Planned timeline:
Week Nov 14-20: discuss with teaching team and deicide our direction for data analysis  
Week Nov 21-28:  tidy data and build basic structure for website  
Week Nov 29- Dec 5: build the module to help predict whether a patient will have disease based on the tidy data and add details to our website  
Week Dec 5-9 : create reporting video
