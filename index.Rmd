### Background

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most people’s bodies naturally produce the hormone insulin, which helps convert sugars from the food we eat into energy that the body can use or store for later. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make insulin or doesn’t use its insulin well, causing your blood sugar to rise. High blood sugar levels can cause serious health problems over time.

### Website overview

Data for this project was required from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.   

In the Exploratory Analysis tab, you will find:

*  Data Overview
*  Distribution of Independent Variables through visualization
*  Analyses of collinearity through collinearity test
*  Association of Age and Pregnancies with Diabetes Occurrence

In the Statistical Analysis tab, you will find:

 * Logistic Model Selection Predicting Diabetes Occurrence through AIC 
 * Diagnostics of Logistic Model

The interactive diabetes predictor tab will take you to a dashboard where you can explore how medical predictors affect the outcome probability of diabetes.
