#### Project Title :

Factors of Diabetes

#### Motivation:

The project intends to analyze factors resulting in diabetes. The
purpose of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient
will have diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in
the dataset. Several constraints select these instances from a larger
database.

#### Intended Final Product:

In this study, we are going to find out which factors influence a
patient’s risk of developing diabetes, and how large the effect is for
each factor and develop a predictive tool for it. We will create a
webpage and a two-minute narrated screencast illustrating our project

#### Data Sources:

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

#### Planned analyses:

Logistic regression model

#### Visualizations:

Use boxplot, barplot, density plot, etc. (ggplot) and interactive plots
(plotly) to visualize the relationship between independent variables and
the occurrence of diabetes \#### Coding challenges: Due to the
complexity of multiple independent variables in this dataset, we need to
spend more time on model selection to build an optimal one for our
project.

#### Planned timeline:

Week Nov 14-20: discuss with teaching team and deicide our direction for
data analysis  
Week Nov 21-28: tidy data and build basic structure for website  
Week Nov 29- Dec 5: build the module to help predict whether a patient
will have disease based on the tidy data and add details to our
website  
Week Dec 5-9 : create reporting video
