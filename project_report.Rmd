### Motivation 

At one time, diabetes was always referred to as a disease of the elderly, yet in fact the incidence of diabetes in young people has increased by nearly 70% in the last decade. With the improvement of living standard, material life is very rich, snacks are varied and many young people do not like to drink plain water, but prefer beverages; the popularity of computers and the Internet has significantly reduced outdoor exercise and lack of physical activity among young people; moreover, young people are living a fast-paced life, often stay up late, and have long-term mental tension, which increases the secretion of hormones that raise blood glucose in the body, such as glucocorticoids and adrenaline. The prevalence of diabetes among young people is increasing at this stage. Therefore, our project uses a model to predict the factors that lead to diabetes and to identify the key factors that lead to diabetes, and then to evaluate the health of the users to determine the probability of diabetes.

### Related work 

After reading the literature “Incidence Trends of Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes among Youths, 2002-2012”, we realized the importance of diabetes prevention in new generation which inspired us to analyze the factors that lead to diabetes and further how to predict the diabetes.
