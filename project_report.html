<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>At one time, diabetes was always referred to as a disease of the
elderly, yet in fact the incidence of diabetes in young people has
increased by nearly 70% in the last decade. With the improvement of
living standard, material life grows richer, various snacks and
high-sugar beverages appear in the market, resulting in the youth’s
distaste for plain water. Moreover, the popularity of computers and the
internet has significantly reduced the youths’ outdoor exercises
frequencies leading to lack in physical activities. Besides, since the
youths usually live a fast-paced life, they often stay up late and
suffer from serious long-term mental tension, which increases the
secretion of hormones that raises blood glucose in the body, such as
glucocorticoids and adrenaline. As a result, the prevalence of diabetes
increases dramatically among young people nowadays.</p>
<p>In addition, epidemiological studies have found that people with
diabetes are more than twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease
as non-diabetics, including premenopausal women, a group that is
generally at lower risk for cardiovascular disease. Although diabetes
affects men and women equally, women are more severely affected by its
consequences. Women are more susceptible to blindness due to diabetic
retinopathy compared to men. Pregnancy may worsen pre-existing diabetic
retinopathy and kidney disease. Women with diabetes are four times more
likely to have a stroke than non-diabetes. Besides vulnerability to
diabetes, women also have less access to healthcare services especially
in low-income countries where economic, political, and social
discrimination is severe. As a result, compared to men, women are more
vulnerable, have less access to treatment and health care, and less
support to cope with the consequences of diabetes.</p>
<p>Therefore, our project aims to find a model to diagnostically predict
whether a female patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements
included in the dataset with the hope of increasing prodromal care
before getting the disease and promoting health keeping behaviors.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related work</h2>
<p>After reading the literature “Incidence Trends of Type 1 and Type 2
Diabetes among Youths, 2002-2012”, we realized the importance of
diabetes prevention in the new generation which inspired us to analyze
the factors that lead to diabetes and further how to predict the
diabetes.</p>
<p>Kapur, A., &amp; Seshiah, V. (2017). <a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5861464/">Women &amp;
diabetes: Our right to a healthy future.</a> The Indian journal of
medical research, 146(5), 553–556.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial questions</h2>
<p>We are trying to find which factors would help us predict diabetes
among all the eight possible variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>We use one dataset drawn from Kaggel which is originally from the
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney. Our dataset
includes 768 observations for 9 varibles. The objective of this dataset
is to predict diabetes diagnostically, based on the medical measurements
in the data. This dataset contains eight independent medical predictors
which might be associated with diabetes occurrence and one dependent
variable <code>outcome</code>. The data source is female patients at
least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.</p>
<p>For the step of data cleaning, we load the raw data, reduce the
outline data for all eight measurements, and reorganize the variables
name. There are no null values, so no action was done to fill the
dataset.</p>
<p>We convert <code>outcome</code> to factor data type for future
analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory analysis</h2>
<div id="variable-distribution" class="section level3">
<h3>Variable Distribution</h3>
<p>We start with visualizing the distributions of variables among each
group, whether the eight diagnostic measurements are related to diabetes
or not. Since our outcome variable is a binary variable, the box plot
were used to visualize the relationship between factors and diabetes.
The y-axis was defined as the diagnostic measurement result and x-axis
were grouped by female with diabetes or not. The results of all box
plots are shown in figure 1.</p>
<p><img src="project_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Results reveal that different groups of females have different
medians of diagnostic results, which indicate that the factors have
linear or nonlinear association with diabetes.</p>
</div>
<div id="collinearity" class="section level3">
<h3>Collinearity</h3>
<p>Before fitting the model, the collinearity between different factors
needed to be tested. We used the corrplot function to test the
collinearity. The plot result shows that there no significant
correlation relationship between all eight variables, although the
SkinThickness variable and Insulin variable has a light purple color
which indicate they might correlated, the index is only about 0.6 which
is not significantly correlated and also we do not include the
SkinThickness variable in the final model which will be discussed later.
Thus, we can conclude that all the eight variables can be used to fit a
model and find the prediction rate of diabetes.</p>
<p><img src="project_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Since the age and pregnancy factors are most concerned. We use the
bar plot to visualize the proportion of diabetes among stratified number
of pregnancies and age group.</p>
</div>
<div id="age" class="section level3">
<h3>Age</h3>
<p>“Men generally have heart disease in their 40’s and 50’s, about a
decade before women. But this is generally not true for diabetic women.
For diabetic women, the cardiovascular risk occurs earlier. Diabetes
takes away much of the protection premenopausal women would normally get
from estrogen.” —Kapur, A., &amp; Seshiah, V. (2017)</p>
<p>According to the figure 3, the diabetes proportion gets higher with
the increase of age variable, and the age group of 50-60 years old has
the highest diabetes proportion. Generally, age factors have a positive
association with diabetes proportion.</p>
<p><img src="project_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="pregnancy" class="section level3">
<h3>Pregnancy</h3>
<p>We also examine the association between pregnancy and diabetes
proportion, as it can be seen in the plot below, as the pregnancy
frequency increases the diabetes proportion also increases, and when the
pregnancy frequency is 17 times, diabetes proportion reaches a hundred
percent.</p>
<p><img src="project_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="statistical-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Statistical analysis</h2>
<div id="model-selection" class="section level3">
<h3>Model Selection</h3>
<p>Since the outcome of diabetes was a binary variable in our dataset(1
= disease, 0 = no disease), we used the Logistic model to obtain the
primary model which includes every diagnostic measurement in the model
to explore the relationship between these measurements and diabetes. A
logistic model models the probability of an event occurring by letting
the log odds of the event be a linear combination of one or more
independent variables. The analysis uses binary variable regression and
models the probability of diabetes occurring with all the variables.
Since the full model includes every measurement and does not perform
statistical analysis and comparisons with other models to see its
predictive ability, therefore it needs to be further analyzed and
improved to get prediction optimization.</p>
<div id="full-model" class="section level4">
<h4>Full model</h4>
<p>The full model result shows <code>Pregnancies</code>,
<code>Glucose</code>, <code>BloodPressure</code>, <code>BMI</code>, and
<code>DiabetesPredigreeFunction</code> are significantly related to
diabetes odds, while <code>SkinThickness</code>, <code>Insulin</code>
and <code>Age</code> are not significantly related to diabetes odds.</p>
<p>The full model gives an AIC around 783. Due to the non-significant
variables included in the model and high AIC, we need to adjust our
model.</p>
</div>
<div id="stepwise-regression" class="section level4">
<h4>Stepwise regression</h4>
<p>The other model was fitted using stepwise regression that is a
step-by-step iterative construction of a regression model involving the
selection of independent variables. It adds or removes potential
explanatory variables one by one and test s for statistical significance
after each iteration. The stepwise regression generates six predictors
of statistical significance including <code>Pregnancies</code>,
<code>Glucose</code>, <code>BloodPressure</code>, <code>BMI</code>, and
<code>DiabetesPredigreeFunction</code>, and <code>Age</code>. The final
model eliminating<code>SkinThickness</code> and <code>Insulin</code> has
a smaller AIC.</p>
</div>
<div id="best-subset-regression" class="section level4">
<h4>Best subset regression</h4>
<p>While stepwise regression select variables sequentially, the best
subsets approach aims to find out the best fit model from all possible
subset models. Best subset regression selects the best model from all
possible subsets according to some goodness-of-fit criteria. The best
model it generated includes seven predictors: ’<code>Pregnancies</code>,
<code>Glucose</code>, <code>BloodPressure</code>, <code>BMI</code>, and
<code>DiabetesPredigreeFunction</code>, and <code>Age</code>, and
<code>Insulin</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="model-comparison" class="section level3">
<h3>Model Comparison</h3>
<p>To compare across three models, we use a cross validation approach
that splits the data into two sets: one set is used to train the model
and the remaining set is used to test the model. We split so that 80% is
used for training a regression model and 20% is used to evaluate the
model performance.</p>
<p>The process works as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build (train) the model on the training data set</li>
<li>Apply the model to the test data set to predict the outcome of new
unseen observations</li>
<li>Quantify the prediction error as the mean squared difference between
the observed and the predicted outcome values.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results are shown in following table.</p>
<center>
<image src='images/table_1.jpeg' style = "width:100%">
</center>
<ul>
<li><p>Mean Absolute Error (MAE) gives the absolute difference between
the actual values and the values predicted by the model for the target
variable. If the value of the outliers does not have much to do with the
accuracy of the model, then MAE can be used to evaluate the performance
of the model.</p></li>
<li><p>Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) assesses how well a model fits
the data it generates.The calculation of the AIC relies on the number of
independent variables used to build the model and the maximum likelihood
estimate of the model. According to AIC, the best-fitting model is the
one that explains the greatest amount of variation with the fewest
independent variables, whichFewer variables will also enhance the
optimization of the model to reduce error. Each redundant predictor
added to the model will introduce a penalty.</p></li>
<li><p>AUC stands for “Area under the ROC Curve.” An ROC curve is a
graph showing the performance of a classification model at all
classification thresholds. AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area
underneath the entire ROC curve. The higher the AUC score, the better
the classification of the predicted values is. For example, if we
consider a model to predict and classify whether the outcome is
‘Diabetes’’ or ‘Normal’, a high AUC indicates that the model is capable
of classifying ‘Diabetes” as ’Diabetes” and ‘Normal’ as ‘Normal’ more
efficiently. There are two reasons why we compare AUC. On one hand, AUC
is scale-invariant. It measures the ranking of predictions rather than
their absolute values. On the other hand, AUC measures the quality of
the model’s predictions irrespective of what classification threshold is
chosen. Full model and subset model’s AUC is slightly higher than the
stepwise model but not with significant statistical value.</p></li>
<li><p>Prediction accuracy was calculated by predicting the testing data
using the model fitted from the training data. If the predicted value is
less than 0.5, we classified it as 0. If the predicted value is larger
than 0.5, we classified it as 1. Then we computed the ratio of predicted
value from the test data to the observed value of testing data to see
how much percentage of the predicted value matched to the observed value
and recorded it as prediction accuracy.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level4">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>From the comparison table, we see that it returns similar values
among RMSE of 0.42, MAE of 0.35, prediction accuracy of 0.74. Stepwise
regression’s AIC and AUC is slightly lower than the full model’s and
subset model’s respectively but the difference is not statistically
significant. Therefore, we select the stepwise regression model with the
fewest predictors following the principle of parsimony.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="model-interpretation" class="section level3">
<h3>Model Interpretation</h3>
<center>
<image src='images/table_2.jpeg' style = "width:100%">
</center>
<p>The final best model generated is as following: <span
class="math inline">\((pi/1-pi) = 0.433 +
1.021(Pregnancies)+1.006(Glucose)+0.998(BloodPressure)+1.013(BMI)+1.151(DiabetesPedigreeFunction)+1.003(Age)\)</span></p>
<p>pi is the probability for diabetes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On average, for one more pregnancy, the estimated increase in
diabetes odds is 1.021, holding other variables constant.</p></li>
<li><p>For one unit increase in glucose, the estimated increase in
diabetes odds on average is 1.006, holding other variables
constant.</p></li>
<li><p>For one mmHg increase in blood pressure, the estimated increase
in diabetes odds on average is 0.998, holding other variables
constant.</p></li>
<li><p>For one unit increase in BMI, the estimated increase in diabetes
odds on average is 1.013, holding other variables constant.</p></li>
<li><p>For one unit increase in diabetes pedigree function, the
estimated increase in diabetes odds on average is 1.151, , holding other
variables constant.</p></li>
<li><p>For one year increase in age, the estimated increase in diabetes
odds on average is around 1.003, holding other variables
constant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The six predictor estimators were listed in the table, and four of
them have a positive association with diabetes. However, we discovered
that the blood pressure and Glucose variables have the estimated odds
around one, which implies no relationship with diabetes. What we expect
is that the Glucose and blood pressure variable will help us predict the
disease of diabetes. One possible explanation is that units of Glucose
and blood pressure variables are very small. A diminutive unit increase
of these two variables results in only a slight change in the outcome of
p/1-pi. Therefore, the coefficient will be close to 1 as the overall
change is little. The small increase is caused by the absolute change in
the values instead of the small influence of glucose and blood pressure
on diabetes.</p>
<p>Glucose and blood pressure will be at their normal range if people do
not have disease, and the odds result of these two only represent the
rate of outcome as unit change as we considered the unit of the glucose
and blood pressure is small. Also, the measure method and difference in
measurement time will affect the glucose and blood pressure result. That
might be the reason why the odds of glucose and blood pressure are
around one</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<div id="key-findings" class="section level3">
<h3>Key findings</h3>
<p>In the process of detailed data analysis, we identified several
variables that were most strongly associated with diabetes:
<code>Pregnancies</code>, <code>Glucose</code>,
<code>Blood Pressure</code>, <code>BMI</code>,
<code>Diabetes Pedigree Function</code> and <code>Age</code>. The key
variables were determined through odds ratio as the model building uses
logistic methods. The logistic full model ,stepwise regression and best
subset models were also obtained to make prediction of whether a patient
will have diabetes or not.</p>
</div>
<div id="expectation" class="section level3">
<h3>Expectation</h3>
<p>In our hypothesis, we expected diabetes to be associated with
pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function
and age.The stepwise model gives the model which contains 6 variables
compared with the five variables model of what we expected, and further
increased the accuracy and prediction ability.</p>
</div>
<div id="insight" class="section level3">
<h3>Insight</h3>
<p>The dataset we analyzed proved that the DiabetesPedigreeFunction
variable has the most important effect on diabetes, which means the
family factor plays an important role in diabetes. Next index refers to
Pregnancies, the more times women have pregnancy, the higher probability
they will have diabetes. For the other variables, glucose and blood
pressure, it will result in the probability of diabetes increasing as
the value of the measurements increase. From the above analysis, the
best way to avoid diabetes is just to look up the family history, try to

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>The R-squared value is 0.27, relatively low, which implies that not

our model. This problem could result from potential influential
outliers. Our model is based on data of only Indian females, its
application generalization and transformity is limited.</p>
